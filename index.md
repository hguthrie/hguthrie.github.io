## Profile

I am an accomplished technical writer and content strategist specializing in emerging technologies,
including generative AI. My recent work involves creating user-facing documentation for an AI platform
while helping plan content frameworks that directly support chatbot training and prompt engineering. I
combine clear communication with systems thinking—translating complex concepts into usable,
scalable content for both people and machines.

See my [mind-mapping skills](mind-mapping.md).
