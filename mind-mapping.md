Mind maps and diagrams are excellent for gathering data, visualizing relationships, and forming ideas. In a product that may seem confusing at first, mind maps can help sort out the connections to certain states, decision trees, process flows, and information sources. It can help to identify crucial pathways for goal-oriented documentation, potentially enhancing the overall user experience.

## Experience using mermaid

Mermaid is a great way to collaborate on diagrams directly in your markdown code, especially if your content is open source. While not always beautiful, it is quick and easy to edit while writing in markdown.
